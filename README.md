# RockPaperScissors
With this project we practice our javaScript skills while making a game of rock paper and scissors.
This is a very famous game internationally where the players choose between the three figures behind their backs and then reveal the asnwer.
The winner varies depending on answers : paper beats rock , rock beats scissors and scissors beats paper.
